Internship dates : february 2023 - august 2023

Author :  Marie Joigneau

Supervisor : Olivier Gimenez https://www.cefe.cnrs.fr/fr/recherche/bc/bbp/843-c/253-olivier-gimenez 

What you have :   
- A first part presenting all my script and my folder organization necessary to do my deep learning models and predictions with some of my lighest DL models (< 100MB for github)   
- A second part for the Office Français de la Biodiversité (OFB) or anyone wanting to do prediction with a deep learning model. It contains user guide (in French and English) and several scripts.   

More precise README are in each part.

I haven't put the Spatial Capture Recapture R script as I have taken most of the part from a Olivier Gimenez R script.   

If you have any questions don't hesitate to contact me,   
Best,
