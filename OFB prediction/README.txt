Here you need to follow the instructions in the user guide (in French or English) to make your predictions.

You have the /OFB_example folder to see what you should obtain at the end

You put all your pictures in the /OFB/dataset_raw folder as instructed in the user guide.

You will also need to open the 4 python scripts when needed.

However the best model is not on the folder /model in this github as it's too heavy (> 100MB). You can try with other models if you want to experience. You have 2 small ones in /Deep Learning script/2_Model-construction/result_model working on pictures of size 224.  
If you are from the Office Français de La Biodiversité, you should have received all the models by another way than github and the real pictures examples.

Don't hesitate to contact me if you encounter any problem,
Best,
Marie
