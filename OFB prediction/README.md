# Deep learning prediction

Dear OFB,

Here you need to follow the instructions in the user guide (in French or English) to make your predictions.

You have the /OFB_example folder to see what you should obtain at the end

You put all your pictures in the /OFB lynx/dataset_raw folder as instructed in the user guide.

You will also need to open the 4 python scripts when needed.

Don't hesitate to contact me if you encounter any problem,
Best,
Marie Joigneau (under the supervision of Olivier Gimenez)
