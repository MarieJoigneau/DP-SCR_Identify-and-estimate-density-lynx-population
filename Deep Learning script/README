Here you have all the script I use to do my deep learning model and predictions.

You also have the skeleton of my folders to understand how I have done. 
But you won't have any pictures as they are under OFB / OCS copyright.

For the script : 
- 1_Pre-processing : permits to prepare the dataset for the model (find the individual on the picture, crop, resize and split the dataset in train/validation/test)
- 1_Pre-processing_change-min-picture : permits to keep the same distribution but delete the individuals with less than X pictures
- 2_Model-construction : permits to create different models depending of different parameters
- 3_Model-test : permits to test the different models to choose the best
- 4_Best-treshold : permits to choose the best treshold when you want to differenciate a new from a re identification (we are in an open population)
- 5_Model-prediction-already-dataset_automatique : predicts new individuals (in 0new folder) when you already have a dataset annoted (automatic way)
- 5_Model-prediction-already-dataset_manuel : predicts new individuals (in 0new folder) when you already have a dataset annoted (manual way)
- 6_Model-prediction_new-dataset : predicts a whole new dataset
- 7_Examine-distribution : examines the distribution of the individuals after their prediction
- 8_individuals-corresponding-for-SCR : gives the association folder-pictures to compare with the human prediction (for Spatial Capture Recapture part)
- Graphes report : all the graphes I have done in my internship


Don't hesitate to contact me if you have any question,
Best,
