# Deep learning script

Here you have all the script I use to do my deep learning model and predictions.

You also have the skeleton of my folders to understand how I have done. 
As you work with OFB, you will also have my pictures.

I advise you to read my report and my presentation before the script for a better understanding.

For the script : 
- 1_Pre-processing : permits to prepare the dataset for the model (find the individual on the picture, crop, resize and split the dataset in train/validation/test)
- 1_Pre-processing_change-min-picture : permits to keep the same distribution but delete the individuals with less than X pictures
- 2_Model-construction : permits to create different models depending of Triplet Loss and KNN metrics and the tranfer learning model
- 2_Model-construction_batch-composition : permits to create different models depending of the batch composition (number of class by batch and number of pictures by batch)
- 2_Model-construction_data-augmentation : permits to create another model without data augmentation
- 2_Model-construction_embedding : permits to create different models depending of the sizes of the dense layers
- 2_Model-construction_min-pic-15 : permits to create another model with at least 15 pictures by individual in the dataset
- 2_Model-construction_BEST-MODEL : I have copied the best model and renamed it with its characteristics for you to remind them
- 3_Model-test : permits to test the different models to choose the best
- 4_Best-treshold : permits to choose the best treshold when you want to differenciate a new from a re identification (we are in an open population)
- 5_Model-prediction-already-dataset_automatique : predicts new individuals (in 0new folder) when you already have a dataset annoted (automatic way)
- 5_Model-prediction-already-dataset_manuel : predicts new individuals (in 0new folder) when you already have a dataset annoted (manual way)
- 6_Model-prediction_new-dataset : predicts a whole new dataset
- 7_Examine-distribution : examines the distribution of the individuals after their prediction
- 8_individuals-corresponding-for-SCR : gives the association folder-pictures to compare with the human prediction (for Spatial Capture Recapture part)
- Graphes report : all the graphes I have done in my internship

For the research of the best model, I have done the following order : 
TL / KNN metrics 
THEN transfer learning models 
THEN min pic 15 
THEN embedding
THEN batch composition
THEN data augmentation

Don't hesitate to contact me if you have any question,
Best,
